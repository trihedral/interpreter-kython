# Kython

A custom python syntax, because semantic whitespace 
is the most obnoxious programming paradigm ever 
conceived. Although perhapse fitting for fans of 
old british comedy.

There are other tweaks as well, generally making 
the syntax more c like.  Other updates to come,
except any actually useful documentation.

To install on linux along with atom and vim 
highlighting, simply run the following command:

git clone `https://github.com/trihedral/interpreter-kython.git`; interpreter-kython/install ~/.local/bin
