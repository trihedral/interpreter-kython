# Kython

A custom python syntax, because semantic whitespace is the most obnoxious
programming paradigm ever conceived. Although perhaps fitting for fans of
old british comedy.

There are other tweaks as well, generally making the syntax more c like.
Other updates to come (except probably any useful documentation).

To tell an executable script where to find the kython interpreter, make this
shebang statement its first line:  
#!/usr/bin/env kython 
Also use the file extension **.ky** to help ID the language for highlighting.


To install kython on linux along with atom and vim highlighting, simply run
the following command:

git clone https://github.com/trihedral/interpreter-kython.git; interpreter-kython/install ~/.local/bin
