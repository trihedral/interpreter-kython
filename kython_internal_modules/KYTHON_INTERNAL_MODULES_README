The kython_internal_modules directory is copied to the bin
of choice by the installer.  Although the bin may be in
PATH, that is not  necessary.  What makes the modules
accessible is that   kython_internal_modules is added to
PYTHONPATH, allowing its contents to be imported into python
scripts.  

Import examples:
from kython.colors import bluBG
import kython.L337 as leet
